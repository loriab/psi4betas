Interfaces: Enhancing |PSIfour| Capabilities
============================================

|PSIfours| capabilites have been expanded by interfacing with other
software packages. These programs aren't necessary 
for |PSIfour| to operate and may require additional licences, special 
platform capabilities, *etc*. 

* :ref:`sec:mrcc` |PSIfour| can drive the MRCC program of M. K\ |a_acute|\ llay and J. Gauss
* :ref:`sec:dftd3` |PSIfour| can drive the DFTD3 program of S. Grimme for DFT-D3 energies and gradients
* MPI4Py
* MADNESS
* MATLAB for new dft functionals
