rasci-ne:     Ne atom RASCI/cc-pVQZ  Example of split-virtual CISD[TQ] from Sherrill and Schaefer, J. Phys. Chem. XXX This uses a "primary" virtual space 3s3p (RAS 2), a "secondary" virtual space 3d4s4p4d4f (RAS 3), and a "tertiary" virtual space consisting of the remaining virtuals.  First, an initial CISD computation is run to get the natural orbitals; this allows a meaningful partitioning of the virtual orbitals into groups of different importance.  Next, the RASCI is run.  The split-virtual CISD[TQ] takes all singles and doubles, and all triples and quadruples with no more than 2 electrons in the secondary virtual subspace (RAS 3).  If any electrons are present in the tertiary virtual subspace (RAS 4), then that excitation is only allowed if it is a single or double.

cc21:         ROHF-EOM-CCSD/DZ analytic gradient lowest $^{2}A@@1$ excited state of H2O+ (B1 excitation)


cc48:         reproduces dipole moments in J.F. Stanton's "biorthogonal" JCP paper


omp2_5-grad2:  OMP2.5 cc-pVDZ gradient for the NO radical


cc47:         EOM-CCSD/cc-pVDZ on H2O2 with two excited states in each irrep


cc35:         CC3(ROHF)/cc-pVDZ H2O $R@@e$ geom from Olsen et al., JCP 104, 8007 (1996)


psimrcc-ccsd_t-1:  Mk-MRCCSD(T) single point. $^1A@@1$ CH2 state described using the Ms = 0 component of the singlet.  Uses RHF singlet orbitals.


dft-dldf:     Dispersionless density functional (dlDF+D) internal match to Psi4 Extensive testing has been done to match supplemental info of Szalewicz et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 103, 263201 (2009) and Szalewicz et. al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 1, 550-555 (2010)


omp3-grad1:   OMP3 cc-pVDZ gradient for the H2O molecule.


omp3-grad2:   OMP3 cc-pVDZ gradient for the NO radical


mp2-grad2:    MP2 cc-pVDZ gradient for the NO radical


dft-pbe0-2:   Internal match to psi4, test to match to literature values in litref.in/litref.out


cc38:         RHF-CC2-LR/cc-pVDZ static polarizabilities of HOF molecule.


opt2-fd:      SCF DZ allene geometry optimzation, with Cartesian input


ghosts:       Density fitted MP2 cc-PVDZ/cc-pVDZ-RI computation of formic acid dimer binding energy using explicit specification of ghost atoms.  This is equivalent to the dfmp2_1 sample but uses both (equivalent) specifications of ghost atoms in a manual counterpoise correction.


fci-dipole:   6-31G H2O Test FCI Energy Point


cc11:         Frozen-core CCSD(ROHF)/cc-pVDZ on CN radical with disk-based AO algorithm
